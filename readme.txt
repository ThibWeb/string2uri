StringToURI readme
TER NÂ°9 M1S2 UM2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

StringToURI is a simple link generation framework which helps creating links between data sets.

Overview :

As stated by its name, StringToURI looks for specified strings inside a data set and tries to find matches inside another data set.
If two strings are equal, the string in the "target / goal / destination / update" data set is replaced by a link to the entity described by the string inside the "source / reference / origin" data set.

This process is delivered in three different fashions :

- Through a library by using its main components : DataSet, Linkage, Output.
- In a much more abstract way using the App class of the library.
- By using one of the ready-to-use tools inside the app package.


Structure :
- The src and test folders contain source code respectively for source files and test files.
-- The util package contains everything needed in order to link datasets together.
-- The app package contains examples of apps ready to be used in a real world context.
- The doc folder contains the javadoc.
- import contains every external library used by StringToURI
- log contains examples of log files as logged by the application.
- rdf contains rdfxml examples.

System requirements :

- Sesame 2.6.4
-- Commons httpclient 3.1
-- Commons codec 1.4
-- Commons logging 1.1.1
-- slf4j api 1.6.4
-- An slf4j implementation 1.6.4
- Commons CLI 1.2 for the CLI apps
- Log4j
- JUnit 4 for the unit tests
